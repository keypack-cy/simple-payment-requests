# Deployment Guide - GitHub Hosting

## 🚀 Hosting on GitHub

### What This Means
- **Code Repository**: Your payment request system code will be stored on GitHub
- **Version Control**: Track changes and updates to your system
- **Easy Sharing**: Others can download and use your system
- **Local Usage**: The application still runs on your mum's computer

### What This Does NOT Mean
- ❌ The app won't run on the internet
- ❌ PDFs won't be stored in the cloud
- ❌ You can't access it from other computers

## 📋 Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Account
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
- Sign up for a free account
- Verify your email

### 2. Create New Repository
- Click the "+" icon in the top right
- Select "New repository"
- Name it: `simple-payment-requests`
- Make it Public (so others can see it)
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
- Click "Create repository"

### 3. Upload Your Code
```bash
# In your project folder, run these commands:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Simple Payment Request System"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simple-payment-requests.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Share the Repository
- Copy the repository URL
- Share it with others who might want to use your system

## 💻 Local Usage (For Your Mum)

### First Time Setup
1. **Download the code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simple-payment-requests.git
   cd simple-payment-requests
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run frontend
   ```

4. **Open in browser**: `http://localhost:3001`

### Daily Usage
- Just run: `npm run frontend`
- Or use the startup script: `./start-app.sh`
- All PDFs are saved locally in the `output` folder

## 🔄 Updating the System

### When You Make Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

### When Your Mum Gets Updates
```bash
git pull origin main
npm install  # Only if dependencies changed
```

## 🌐 Alternative: Full Web Hosting

If you want to make this accessible from anywhere on the internet, you'd need:

### Option 1: Heroku (Free Tier Available)
- Host the Node.js backend
- Use a database for client storage
- PDFs stored in cloud storage
- More complex setup

### Option 2: Vercel/Netlify + Backend
- Frontend on Vercel/Netlify
- Backend on a separate service
- More complex and not free

## 💡 Why Local Hosting is Perfect for Your Mum

1. **Privacy**: All data stays on her computer
2. **No Internet Required**: Works offline after setup
3. **Fast**: No network delays
4. **Secure**: No external access to her data
5. **Simple**: Just double-click to start
6. **Free**: No hosting costs

## 📱 Making It Even Easier

### Create a Desktop Shortcut
1. Right-click on desktop
2. New → Shortcut
3. Browse to your project folder
4. Select `start-app.sh` (or `start-app.bat` on Windows)
5. Name it "Payment Requests"

### Windows Users
Create `start-app.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting Payment Request System...
npm run frontend
pause
```

## 🎯 Summary
